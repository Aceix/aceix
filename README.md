### Hi there 👋

I'm Kwesi, an ever-learning extraordinary software engineer and designer.

Big fan of motorsports 🏎️🏍️🏁 and open-source software 👨‍💻😎!


#### Experience

- I developed 12factor-compliant microservices for a PoC trading engine with Java Spring boot which communicated via [SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/), [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) and [Message Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue).
To facilitate easy testing, integration and deployment, I also built CI/CD pipelines with Github Actions.
  
  Tech: `Java Spring boot`, `Heroku`, `GitHub Actions`, `Postgres`, `Angular`

- I built a multitenant healthcare platform frontend with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), using [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management, whiles strictly following the MVVM model. The web application featured [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) for telemedicine support, [WebSockets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for live update of patient EMR and appointments data. I optimised the load times with [Webpack code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/). I implemented Role-based Access Control (RBAC) on the frontend, to show authorised users what is relevant and enabled to them. I also worked on deploying the app on AWS S3 and CloudFront edge locations for better load times.
  
  Tech: `Vue`, `Vuex`, `JavaScript`, `AWS CloudFront`, `AWS S3`, `Figma`

- I have built microservices and deployed them with Terraform to an Azure infrastructure that handle scales to handle varying workloads. I have also setup monitoring for the services with Datadog. I helped build the GUI in Angular. Unlike other project where I usually use ORMs, I learnt to write performant SQL queries. I also got familiar with the [CQRS pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), amongst other code design patterns such as Builder, Factory, Singleton and Command.
  
  Tech: `Java`, `Angular`, `Microsoft SQL Server`, `SQL`, `Terraform`, `Azure`, `Datadog`

- I have also worked on other projects where I gained substantial experience in `React`, `Go`, `Electron`, `IoT`, `Blockchain/Web3.0`. Some projects are:
  - Regulus (https://regulus.finance/)
  - GoFiber Docs (https://gofiber.io/)
  - Gofer (https://gofer.com.gh/)
  - Youdle (https://github.com/Aceix/youdle)
  - Rescript (https://github.com/Aceix/rescript)

Although I love [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/) 😊, I pick the right tool for a task, considering things like community, maintainability and ease of use.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear...")
}
```
